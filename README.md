#Grivet
I'm teaching myself how to web programming by making a note taking application.
Not a very original idea but while I'm at it I may as well make an interesting app.

Grivet is:
*minimal: notes are just text, organization is done with tags, and the interface should be equally simple
*organized on-the-fly: tagging is done by writing hashtags in notes


###Fetchnotes
It turns out my idea of organizing notes by hashtag isn't as original as I thought. So if you want a note taking app
that works this way right now give [Fetchnotes](http://www.fetchnotes.com/) a try.
