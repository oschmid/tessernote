#Tessernote
I'm teaching myself how to web programming by making a note taking app.

Tessernote is:
- minimal: notes are just text, organization is done with tags, and the interface is equally simple
- organized on-the-fly: tagging is done by writing hashtags in notes

###Dependencies
- [go-appengine-sdk 1.7.3](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Go)
- gae-go-testing ([install guide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11286534/test-cases-for-go-and-appengine))

###Fetchnotes
It turns out my idea of organizing notes by hashtag isn't as original as I thought. So if you want a note taking app
that works this way right now give [Fetchnotes](http://www.fetchnotes.com/) a try.
