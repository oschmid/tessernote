Grivet
=====

Notes applications are all organized the same boring way: notes in lists.
So a note about "Diving the Great Barrier Reef" can only be stored under "Bucket List" or "What to do in Australia" 
or "Vacation Ideas" but not all of them at the same time. That's lame.

Grivet is different. Instead of directories, Grivet uses tags. So your one note appears in multiple places.
